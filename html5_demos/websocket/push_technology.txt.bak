WebSockets also provide an elegant implementation of push technology.  Push technology refers to communication that is initiated by the server.  This contrasts the typical Web communication model of client initiated communication (also known as pull technology).  Prior to HTML5, push technology was implemented through a number of hacks such as long polling.  In long polling, the client makes an AJAX request to the server.  If the server doesn’t have any data to return, it simply leaves the connection open.  Once data becomes available, the server sends it back to the client.  The client then immediately makes another request, ensuring that an open connection is always available for push data.  WebSockets make these techniques obsolete by providing true push technology.  The additional overhead of repeatedly polling the server is also mitigated by using WebSockets.
